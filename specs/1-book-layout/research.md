# Research Plan

This document outlines the research tasks required for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book.

## Phase 1: Research

The research phase will run concurrently with the planning and content creation phases. The primary goal is to gather authoritative, accurate, and up-to-date information for each chapter.

### Research Tasks

1.  **Identify Official Documentation:**
    *   **ROS 2:** Humble and Iron distributions.
    *   **Gazebo:** Latest stable version.
    *   **Unity:** Latest LTS version with a focus on robotics simulation.
    *   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim:** Latest version, including Isaac ROS gems.
    *   **Whisper:** OpenAI's documentation and API.

2.  **Collect Peer-Reviewed Sources:**
    *   Search academic databases (IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, arXiv) for papers on:
        *   Humanoid robotics
        *   Sim-to-real transfer
        *   Vision-Language-Action models
        *   Robot perception and navigation
        *   Digital twins in robotics

3.  **Gather Example Code and Setups:**
    *   Collect tested and runnable code snippets for all core technologies.
    *   Document the precise environment and dependencies required for each example.
    *   Investigate best practices for structuring ROS 2 packages and launch files for humanoid robots.

### Citation Management

- All sources will be tracked in a central bibliography file.
- Citations will follow APA style, as per the Constitution.
- The validity and accessibility of all sources will be verified.
