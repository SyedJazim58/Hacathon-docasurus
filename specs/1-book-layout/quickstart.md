# Quickstart

This document provides instructions for setting up the Docusaurus environment to build and view the book.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn

## Setup

1.  **Install Docusaurus:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

This will start a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

To generate a static site bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
