# Chapter 2: Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions

This chapter delves into the fundamental communication mechanisms within ROS 2: Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions. It will explain how these components interact to form the distributed ROS 2 graph, enabling modular and scalable robotic applications. We will cover the purpose and usage of each communication primitive with practical examples.
