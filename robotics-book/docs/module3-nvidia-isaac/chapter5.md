# Chapter 5: Sim-to-Real Transfer Concepts

This chapter delves into the critical challenges and strategies for achieving successful sim-to-real transfer in robotics. We will discuss techniques such as domain randomization, transfer learning, and adaptation methods that enable policies trained in simulation to perform effectively on real-world humanoid robots. Practical considerations and case studies will be examined.
