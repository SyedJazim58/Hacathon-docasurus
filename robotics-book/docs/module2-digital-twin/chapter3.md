# Chapter 3: Robot Models: URDF and SDF

This chapter compares and contrasts URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and SDF (Simulation Description Format) for defining robot models in simulation environments. We will cover the strengths and weaknesses of each format, how to convert between them, and best practices for creating accurate and versatile robot models for digital twin applications.
