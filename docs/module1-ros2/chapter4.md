# Chapter 4: Robot Description with URDF

This chapter introduces the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), an XML format for representing a robot model. We will explore how to define a robot's kinematics, visualize its structure, and integrate URDF models into ROS 2 environments. The chapter will cover best practices for creating extensible and modular robot descriptions.
