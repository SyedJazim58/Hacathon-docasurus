# Chapter 2: Gazebo for Physics Simulation

This chapter introduces Gazebo, a powerful 3D robotics simulator widely used for developing and testing robot applications. We will cover the basics of setting up Gazebo, simulating robotic systems, and interacting with the simulation environment through ROS 2. The chapter will demonstrate how to create virtual testbeds for humanoid robots.
