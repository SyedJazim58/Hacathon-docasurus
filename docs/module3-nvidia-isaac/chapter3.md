# Chapter 3: Navigation and Path Planning

This chapter focuses on navigation and path planning for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac SDK. We will explore algorithms for mapping environments, localizing the robot within those maps, and generating collision-free paths to desired goals. The chapter will cover both traditional and AI-driven approaches to robot navigation.
